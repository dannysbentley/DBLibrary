# Project Name
Collection of useful methods which will help me and maybe others develop faster.  
The methods as of now are mostly used for Revit development, however, in the future I will add common methods which I can use with addins. 

## Installation
Copy .dll file and .addin to the [Revit Add-Ins folder](http://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2015/ENU/?guid=GUID-4FFDB03E-6936-417C-9772-8FC258A261F7).
Also look at my [DBLibrary](https://github.com/dannysbentley/DBLibrary) for missing methods. 

## Usage

Works in conjuntion with Revit. Developed with Revit API 2016.
